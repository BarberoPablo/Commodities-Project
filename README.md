## Project description:
We designed and developed a service business to business for importers/exporters of International Commodities with a login, bookmarks, user profile, administrator profile and a payment gateaway with Paypal.
Upon loggin in or registering, users can create a post offering/searching certain types of commodities. 
Users who wants to have access to the contact information of another user, they can do that by acquiring a membership.
Anyone can save posts as favorites and once logged in this favorites can be accesed by going to the profile button (if the user already had favorites, this new ones will be attached to the old ones).
Users are able to send a review and giving a score to another user as long as they already made contact. This reviews can be reported if the user finds them offensive.
The page has an administrator panel where a special user (admin), can hide reported posts, ban users, modify memberships or create new ones with certain benefits.

## Technologies used: 
Javascript, NodeJS (Sequelize, Express), ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, SQL (PostgreSQL), Auth0, Paypal Developer, HTML, CSS.
