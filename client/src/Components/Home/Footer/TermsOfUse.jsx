              If claims about results from using this service or if claims about income or earnings resulting from the use of this service are made
              (like success stories, happy customers, etc.), such claims are true for the persons who made the claims, including claims made by this
              website about its own experience. However, User cannot simply rely on these statements as being duplicable by User because many factors
              affect results, including just dumb luck. Nothing promoted on this website should be construed as a 'Get rich quick' scheme. The income
              and earnings statements, if any, tend to reflect the more successful cases and User should not construe this as being the 'average' or
              usual success story.
